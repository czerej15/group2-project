    - the data was originally too complicated and too much
    - decided to just do two rows of each to simplify things, other rows could be added later
    - then it was imputing the data so that the data was in the correct format
    - decided to create a class instance every time a row was read
    - access the instance via a dictionary
    - the student input is complete so all the otehrs are based off it


Assumptions we made:
- students' currently enrolled courses are for the current semester (S2 2021)
- students can only enrol in next semester (S1 2022)
- students can only enrol & uneroll in current semester (S2 2021)


Live demo:
- start with STUDENT MENU
- sign in as 's3900781' (my student thing so i can easily remember)




- move on to ADMIN MENU

- remove semester S12022 first
- add semester S12022
