Meeting Notes
--- 
    - the data was originally too complicated and too much
    - decided to just do two rows of each to simplify things, other rows could be added later
    - then it was imputing the data so that the data was in the correct format
    - decided to create a class instance every time a row was read
    - access the instance via a dictionary
    - the student input is complete so all the otehrs are based off it
